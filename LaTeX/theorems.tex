\section{Introduction}
Theorems can easily be defined
 
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be a function whose derivative exists in every point, then $f$ is 
a continuous function.
\end{theorem}
 
\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
\label{pythagorean}
This is a theorema about right triangles and can be summarised in the next 
equation 
\[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]
\end{theorem}
 
And a consequence of theorem \ref{pythagorean} is the statement in the next 
corollary.
 
\begin{corollary}
There's no right rectangle whose sides measure 3cm, 4cm, and 6cm.
\end{corollary}
 
You can reference theorems such as \ref{pythagorean} when a label is assigned.
 
\begin{lemma}
Given two line segments whose lengths are $a$ and $b$ respectively there is a 
real number $r$ such that $b=ra$.
\end{lemma}

Unnumbered theorem-like environments are also possible.
 
\begin{remark}
This statement is true, I guess.
\end{remark}
 
And the next is a somewhat informal definition
 
%\theoremstyle{definition}
\begin{definition}{Fibration}
A fibration is a mapping between two topological spaces that has the homotopy lifting property for every space $X$.
\end{definition}
